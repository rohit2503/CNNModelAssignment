# Project Name
To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths.
A solution which can evaluate images and alert the dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis

## General Information
- Provide general information about your project here.
- What is the background of your project?
  The project main aim is build a CNN model that can be used by dermatologists and doctors for an early detection of skin cancer called melanoma. Since this is curable when detected at an ealry stage, we could
  save people dying from this disease.
- What is the business probem that your project is trying to solve?
  Melanoma is deadly skin cancer if found at an early stage then it can be cured. The dermatologists can be alerted at an eary stage and this could save manual effort for the diagnosis.
- The data used for creating this model consist of 2357 images of malignant and benign oncological diseases, which were formed from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC).
  The data set consist of following disease images:
   - The data set contains the following diseases:
	Actinic keratosis
	Basal cell carcinoma
	Dermatofibroma
	Melanoma
	Nevus
	Pigmented benign keratosis
	Seborrheic keratosis
	Squamous cell carcinoma
	Vascular lesion
